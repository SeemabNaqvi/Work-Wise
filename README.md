## Developer Contribution Note

This project was one of my earliest experiences during my training at Masai School. At that time, I was still learning core JavaScript concepts, while the team lead was exploring advanced technologies like **Next.js**, **schema validation**, and **component architecture**.

### My main contributions included:
- Working closely with the lead developer to understand the structure of a real-world Next.js project  
- Assisting in organizing and maintaining the documentation and README  
- Learning how schema validation, routing, and frontend frameworks operate in large applications  
- Supporting the planning and conceptual workflow of task logging and productivity features  

This project played an important role in helping me understand how fullstack applications are architected, even before I was fully hands-on with advanced technologies.
